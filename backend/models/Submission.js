// if we are executing the frontend code the best way to evaluate is to keep a copy of ui which we want to make and just compare it the code's executed screenshot(by pupeteer) if comparison is >95% then its passed  either we have to check each test case if using llms or manually it will be a lot of work and error prone too as we have to be very precise with the dom elements used by user
